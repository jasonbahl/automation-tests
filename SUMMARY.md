# Summary of Accomplishments

## Node.js Scripts

- Created `generate-changeset.js` for generating changeset files from PR metadata
- Created `generate-release-notes.js` for formatting release notes from changesets
- Created `analyze-changesets.js` for determining version bump type based on changesets
- Created `bump-version.js` for updating version numbers in plugin files
- Created `update-changelog.js` for updating CHANGELOG.md with new entries
- Created `update-readme.js` for updating readme.txt with new entries
- Created `update-changelogs.js` for updating both changelog files at once
- Created `build.js` for building the plugin for release

## GitHub Workflows

- Modified `generate-changeset.yml` to:
  - Use PR merge trigger instead of label-based trigger
  - Improve permissions handling with GitHub token
  - Generate changesets for merged PRs
  - Use temporary files for release notes to keep the repository clean
  - Use the `generate-release-notes.js` script for better formatted release notes
  - Automatically create or update a release PR from develop to main
- Improved `release-management.yml` for automating version bumping and changelog updates:
  - Extract release notes from PR body when merging to main
  - Auto-detect version bump type from changesets
  - Update both CHANGELOG.md and readme.txt
  - Create GitHub release with formatted release notes
  - Delete processed changesets to prevent duplicate changelog entries
- Updated `deploy.yml` for handling deployments:
  - Deploy to WordPress.org SVN
  - Create GitHub release with assets
  - Add release notes to GitHub release

## Documentation

- Updated README.md with comprehensive overview of the project
- Created detailed workflow documentation:
  - Changeset generation process with temporary file handling
  - Release management workflow
  - Deployment process
- Added examples and usage instructions for all scripts
- Documented breaking change detection and handling
- Added information about the new `generate-release-notes.js` script and how to use it locally

## Testing

- Implemented local testing for all scripts
- Created test fixtures for changesets
- Added validation for script inputs
- Ensured scripts can be run both in CI and locally

## Benefits of Our Approach
- **Testability**: All automation logic is in Node.js scripts that can be tested locally
- **Reusability**: Scripts can be used both in CI/CD and by developers locally
- **Maintainability**: Logic is centralized in scripts rather than duplicated in workflow files
- **Flexibility**: Workflows can be customized without changing the core logic
- **Consistency**: Ensures standardized processes for versioning and releases
- **Efficiency**: Combined operations reduce duplication and potential for inconsistencies
- **Cleanliness**: Use of temporary files keeps the repository clean

## Next Steps
- Test scripts with various scenarios to ensure robustness
- Refine based on team feedback
- Migrate to production repositories
- Extend with additional automation scripts
- Improve documentation with examples

## Recent Updates

- **Environment Variables Support**: Added support for environment variables (`REPO_URL` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`) to simplify configuration and usage of the release notes script.
- **Contributor Recognition**: Enhanced release notes to include a contributors section with special recognition for first-time contributors.
- **GitHub Workflow Improvements**: Updated the GitHub workflow to use environment variables instead of command-line arguments, making it cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Temporary File Handling**: Improved the workflow to use temporary files for release notes, keeping the repository clean.
- **Changeset Cleanup**: Changed from archiving changesets to deleting them after a release to prevent duplicate changelog entries.
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive documentation updates to reflect new features and options.
